<p>* If you do not use the AMAZON c9.io IDE, use flash drive for backing up your lab works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Software Development:</strong><br />For this course, we will be using a cloud Integrated Development Environment<br />(cloud IDE) called <a href="https://c9.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://c9.io</a>. The software is open-source and is available as a free download. If you do not already have an account, please create&nbsp;an account immediately. The c9.io does&nbsp;offer a&nbsp;free basic account, you need to provide a credit card number to register for the free account. If you feel more comfortable using another platform, &nbsp;such as <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code::Blocks</a>, you are welcome to do so. However, for this class I<span>&nbsp;only support the cloud IDE c9.io. All compilation problems or questions for&nbsp;IDEs other than&nbsp;c9.io can only be served when time&nbsp;permitted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The main advantage for using the cloud IDE c9.io is its&nbsp;support and compatibility to the C++ 11 and 14 standards. &nbsp;Therefore, we only support the cloud IDE c9.io in this class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Course Assignments and Exams:</strong><br />The course will requires 10 assignments, midterm and final exams. <strong>Exams cannot be made up or rescheduled for any reason &ndash;</strong> <strong>please</strong> <strong>plan your schedule around them.</strong></p>
<p>Assignments (+ Labs) 60%, midterm 15%, and final 25%.</p>
<p>Final letter grades are based on the following overall course percentage:</p>
<p>90 &ndash; 100 &nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A<br />80 &ndash; &nbsp; 89 &nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B<br />70 &ndash; &nbsp; 79 &nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C<br />60 &ndash; &nbsp; 69 &nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D<br />&nbsp; 0 &ndash; &nbsp; 59 &nbsp; %&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>*The final grade will be curved to the adjusted median. In case the class median for total points is less than 900 points (90%), the class median will be adjusted&nbsp;(curved) to 900 points. The raw total points will be adjusted to this ratio. For example, if the class median is 800 points, it will be multiplied by 9/8 or 1.125 to move to 900.&nbsp; For a total points of 850 will be adjusted to a final score of 956 (95.6%).</p>
<p><strong>Submission of Assignments:</strong><br />Assignment report must be submitted&nbsp;on time, i.e. before the posted due time&nbsp;on the CANVAS calendar. Please be conscience about the due time&nbsp;and give yourself enough time to work on the&nbsp;homework problems.<br />Please submit&nbsp;ONE and only one all-inclusive report file per assignment. The homework report must contain both the source code and validation rest run console output. The preferred report format&nbsp;would be the Online Entry&nbsp;type.</p>
<p>The source code copied and pasted directly on&nbsp;text&nbsp;&nbsp;and a screen shot of one or more runs included in the same word document where the source code is. You can use open office (free) if you do not have MS word. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that assignments submitted any other will not be accepted for grading. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Class Policy:</strong><br />Expect to spend about 30 hours per week on this course. Note: you have much less time to complete the material than if this was a regular 16 week course. Therefore, you have to mobilize yourself and spend enough time every day so you do not fall behind.</p>
<p>Assignments, In-class exercises and other materials are posted on the class website in D2L</p>
<p>Please refer to the tentative schedule table attached to this syllabus for due dates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You are expected to pre-read the material for the indicated week's reading assignment in the course outline, the lecture notes and the power point slides for the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For questions on assignments, and any other course related questions, use the D2L discussion board. Students may post and reply to questions in order to help each other. Use this method so that all students benefit from questions, answers, and clarifications.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about lectures, exams, etc. please email&nbsp; HYPERLINK "mailto:tchern@dvc.edu" using D2L email.&nbsp; When emailing instructor, please type <strong>COMS110_SectionNumber_Your Name_ content of the email</strong>&nbsp;in the subject line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arrangements for missed exams must be made with the instructor in advance. Final Exam cannot be missed.</p>
<p>No credit will be given for work that is plagiarized. Points awarded for work that is later found to be plagiarized will be withdrawn. Please do not delete (loose) your assignments from your computers or flash drives until the end of the semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dropping from Class</strong></p>
<p>If for any reason you need to stop attending class it is <strong>your responsibility</strong> to contact the admissions office and withdraw from the class. If you haven't dropped and your name shows up on the <strong>FINAL Class Roster</strong> I have to put an "<strong>F</strong>" &ndash; Sorry but it&rsquo;s a School Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Incomplete&nbsp;</strong><br />The &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; grade was designed for students who have a last minute &ldquo;<strong>disastrous</strong>&rdquo; event (serious illness, death in the family) that prevents them from completing the course. A student must be passing prior to the &ldquo;<strong>disaster</strong>&rdquo;, must have more than 50 percent of the work completed, and evidence of the &ldquo;<strong>disaster</strong>&rdquo; must be supplied to the instructor. The instructor has sole discretion of whether to issue the incomplete. Incompletes are<strong> rarely given </strong>and do require a contract between the student and instructor about what work is to be made up and the time limit in which it is to be finished.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Student Privacy Rights Policy</strong><br />The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a law that protects students from having their education records shared with people without the student giving their advance approval in writing.&nbsp; (Education records include such things as grades, information from counseling appointments, academic standing, disciplinary records, to name a few.)&nbsp; FERPA also gives students the right to see their education records.&nbsp; If there is inaccurate or misleading information in their records, students can challenge it and try to get it changed.&nbsp; Under FERPA, colleges must have students&rsquo; written permission to let parents, guardians, spouses, or others see or discuss their educational records, even if the student is present. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The DVC Students Privacy Policy is located at: <a href="http://www.dvc.edu/org/info/policies/privacy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.dvc.edu/org/info/policies/privacy.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</strong><br />If you have a documented disability and wish to discuss academic accommodations, or if you would need assistance in the event of an emergency, please contact me as soon as possible.<br />Students who require alternative formats for course materials or adaptive equipment because of a specific disability can request them through the Disability Support Services office. The High Tech Center on the Pleasant Hill Campus (in LC-107) is an adaptive technology computer lab available for students with disabilities and is open Monday-Thursday from 9am-5pm, and Fridays from 9am-1pm. Please contact Carrie Million in LC-112 or at 925-685-1230 ext. 2553 for more information.</p>
