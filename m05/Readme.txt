// Module 5 Function - Intro

Prgramming Paradyne - Local Meaning v. External Function

Function is to organize the functionality as an independent code body,
to be used by another code.

However, this also alienate the meaning of local variables...

The improvement done to smaller functions is to make functor 
or Lambda expression instead.

In-class exercise:

1a. change pr6-24.cpp line 6 to the following 
   void displayStars(int = 10, int );
then change it back.

1b. change pr6-24.cpp line 24 to the following
   void displayStars(int cols=4, int rows=1)
